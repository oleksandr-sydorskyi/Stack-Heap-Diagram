Initial State (in main() method):

Stack:
name (points to the string "Kevin").
list (points to an empty ArrayList).
times (set to 10).
Heap:
"Kevin" (string object).
Empty ArrayList object.
Method Call: fill(list, name + name, times):

Arguments:
list: points to the empty ArrayList object.
name + name: evaluates to "KevinKevin", a new string object in the heap.
times: is 10.
Method Call: fill(Collection<String> collection, String str, int times):

Stack:
collection: points to the ArrayList object.
str: points to the string "KevinKevin".
times: is 10.
Method Call: shrink(String str):

Stack:
str: points to the string "KevinKevin".
Heap:
A new char[] array is created with size 5.
The array chars contains: ['K', 'v', 'n', 'e', 'i'].
A new string "Kvnei" is created from the chars array and stored in the heap.
Back to fill():

shrunk is now "Kvnei".
times is recalculated as (times + shrunk.length()) / 2 = (10 + 5) / 2 = 7.
The loop adds "Kvnei" to the ArrayList three times (since times / 2 = 3).
Heap:
The ArrayList now holds 3 references to the string "Kvnei".
Return from fill():

fill() returns 7.
Back to main():

The final print statement outputs 17 (times = 10 and fill() returned 7).
Final Stack-Heap Diagram:
Stack:
name: points to "Kevin".
list: points to the ArrayList object.
times: 10 in main(), and 7 in fill().
collection, str, times: local variables in fill().
str in shrink(): points to "KevinKevin".
Return value of fill(): 7.
Heap:
"Kevin" (string object).
"KevinKevin" (string object).
"Kvnei" (string object, result of the shrink() method).
ArrayList object with 3 references to "Kvnei".
This diagram accurately represents how variables and objects are allocated in the stack and heap, following the code execution step by step.
